Event Bubbling means when an event happens on a child element, it first runs on that element and then "bubbles up" to its parent, then grandparent, and so on up to the root (`document`).

Event Delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of adding listeners to multiple child elements. The event bubbles up, and you check which child triggered it.

preventDefault() - Stops the browserâ€™s default action ( preventing form submission, stopping a link from opening).
stopPropagation() - Stops the event from bubbling up (or capturing down) to parent elements.
